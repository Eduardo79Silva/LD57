# 🧲 DeepMine — A Strategic Mining Game

**DeepMine** is a 72-hour game jam project built in Unity for Ludum Dare 57, based on the theme **"Depth."**  
It’s a physics-inspired, systems-driven mining game where every dig decision counts — built from scratch with a focus on **emergent gameplay**, **grid-based systems**, and **tool-based interaction loops**.

> 💬 _"Drill smart. Support wisely. Collapse is just one wrong move away."_

## 🎮 Gameplay Summary

- Use **tools** like drills, supports, and magnets to navigate an unstable underground world.
- Collect **valuable ores** and **sell them** at the surface to upgrade your loadout.
- Strategically place supports to avoid **chain collapses** and lost resources.
- **Ores that collapse** are **lost forever** — making efficient, careful digging the core mechanic.

## 🧠 Systems Implemented

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧱 Grid System | Dynamic 2D grid that tracks block state, supports, and player actions |
| ⛏️ Collapse Logic | Tension-based collapse system that triggers chain reactions |
| 🏗️ Support Placement (In Development) | Preview ghost + grid snapping visuals to reinforce fragile terrain |
| 🛒 Upgrade Store (In Development) | Buy tools and supports with earned ore profits |
| 🎒 Inventory System (In Development) | Carry up to 10 items, swap and use interactively |
| 📜 Game Loop | Procedural generation → resource collection → strategic upgrades |

## 💼 Career Highlights

This project was built to strengthen and showcase my skills in:

- **Gameplay programming** (tools, feel, physics interaction)
- **Systems design** (modular inventory/store/upgrade architecture)
- **Code architecture for scalability**
- **Game feel & UX polish under time constraints**

If you’re looking for a **junior gameplay programmer** passionate about deep systems, player expression, and clean code, feel free to reach out!
